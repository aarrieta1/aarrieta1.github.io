			<p><strong>Ally Arrieta</strong> started writing songs when she was fourteen. A native of Los Angeles, she grew up singing along to Lauryn Hill, Crystal Lewis, and Stevie Wonder. She was recognized at an early age for her songwriting ability by the Grammy Foundation when she was selected to participate in a music program for high school aged singer-songwriters called Grammy Camp. Since that time, she has performed in numerous venues across California, including the Grammy Museum in L.A., national student conferences, and intimate venues like Acoustic Jukebox and Red Rock Cafe in the Bay Area. She has a knack for writing vulnerable lyrics about faith, love, and relationships. As a vocalist, she has developed a unique style, influenced by her experience singing in jazz combos. She attends Stanford University, where she majors in English and Creative Writing.</p>
			<p>Young, her 3 song EP which will be released in May 2014, is her first project.</p>
